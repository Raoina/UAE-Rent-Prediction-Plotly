# UAE Rent Prediction Dashboard

![UAE Rent Prediction Banner](https://www.sealra.com/media/images/banner.jpg)

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based interactive dashboard for predicting annual rental prices of properties in the UAE using machine learning. It provides data insights, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and an intuitive user interface for users to input property features and get estimated rent values.

The application combines **Flask** and **Dash** frameworks with an XGBoost regression model trained on real rental data across major UAE cities.

---

## Features

- **Rent Prediction**: Input property features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, area, property type, furnishing status, and city to get a predicted annual rent.
- **Data Insights**: Interactive plots showing distributions and relationships within the rental dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed steps, findings, and dataset overview.
- **REST API**: Endpoint for prediction to integrate with other systems or services.

## Dataset

- The data contains rental listings from major UAE cities including Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Ras Al Khaimah, Umm Al Quwain, and Al Ain.
- Features include property type, rent, area size, furnishing status, city, and more.
- Original dataset source: [Kaggle - Real Estate Goldmine Dubai UAE Rental Market](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azharsaleem/real-estate-goldmine-dubai-uae-rental-market)
